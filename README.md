AbStretch
=========

Ab Stretch is a handset Android application that solves the problem of quantifying core (ab) and mobility (stretching) for athletes. My triathlon coach suggests I stretch and do 100 sit-ups everyday, but Garmin or other watchmakers don't have a way to track these activities over time. Ab Stretch is the answer.
